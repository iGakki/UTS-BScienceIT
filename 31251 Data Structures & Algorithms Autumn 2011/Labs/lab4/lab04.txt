Sorting and Classes
===================


Q1

a) Fix the syntax errors in class.cpp so that it compiles.

b) Complete the code for the swap function.

c) Test the program and correct any bugs you find.


To see how class.cpp is supposed to work you can run
/home/glingard/class

LAB SUBMISSION

After you have debugged class.cpp you will submit it using the following 
command
/home/glingard/submitlab4 class.cpp

The submission program will check that class.cpp compiles correctly and
passes a number of simple tests. If your submission does pass these
tests it will be accepted otherwise it will be rejected for submission.

You may attempt to submit as many times as you like till the due date.

If your program is accepted for submission a file called receipt.txt
will be placed in your current directory. You may look at the contents
of this file but DO NOT change anything in it. It is your receipt that 
you have submitted your lab exercise and changing it will render it
null and void. Move it to somewhere safe where it will not be over 
written or lost.

Successful submission of the program is worth 1%
