Pointers & Call by Reference
============================

Q1

a) Compile and run the program address.cpp

b) What is this program telling you?

Q2

a) The program prime.cpp has some syntax errors. Fix
   these errors and run the program.

b) After testing the program you will notice that the 
   program has some logical errors. For instance, it says
   that 4 is prime while 5 is not. It also says that 
   every number you enter is invalid. Please fix these 
   so the program works correctly.


LAB SUBMISSION

After you have debugged prime.cpp you will submit it using the following 
command
/home/glingard/submitlab2 prime.cpp

The submission program will check that prime.cpp compiles correctly and
passes a number of simple tests. If your submission does pass these
tests it will be accepted otherwise it will be rejected for submission.

You may attempt to submit as many times as you like till the due date.

If your program is accepted for submission a file called receipt.txt
will be placed in your current directory. You may look at the contents
of this file but DO NOT change anything in it. It is your receipt that 
you have submitted your lab exercise and changing it will render it
null and void. Move it to somewhere safe where it will not be over 
written or lost.

Please Note. If you are submitting from the labs you cannot run the
submission system from your local home directory. It does not have
access to my home directory. You have to ssh to rerun and submit 
from there.

Successful submission of the program is worth 1%


SUBMISSION CONDITIONS

Due date 11.59pm 23/3/11

Late submisions will not be accepted as I will be releasing the solution 
the following day.

Lab submissions will only be accepted via the submission system.

This is not a group exercise. Please read the Subject Outline regarding
acceptable behaviour.

You do not have to submit anything else in this lab.

c) What happens to the program when you enter a negative
   number? Can you fix this problem? Do you see the need
   to carefully test your program after you have written
   it?
