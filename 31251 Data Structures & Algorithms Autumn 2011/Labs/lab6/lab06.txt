TEMPLATES & LISTS
=================

The code for this lab requires you to use the link list code used
in lecture 6.

The dlist code and its iterators and dnode are included in the lab
and you will need to copy them to the directory where your are doing
your lab.

You can assume that this code is working properly. You don't need
a makefile and can compile your code with 
g++ list.cpp

Q1

a) Fix the syntax errors in list.cpp so that it compiles.

c) Test the program and correct any bugs you find.


To see how list.cpp is supposed to work you can run
/home/glingard/list /home/glingard/addam.txt

LAB SUBMISSION

After you have debugged list.cpp you will submit it using the following 
command
/home/glingard/submitlab6 list.cpp

The submission program will check that list.cpp compiles correctly and
passes a number of simple tests. If your submission does pass these
tests it will be accepted otherwise it will be rejected for submission.

You may attempt to submit as many times as you like till the due date.

If your program is accepted for submission a file called receipt.txt
will be placed in your current directory. You may look at the contents
of this file but DO NOT change anything in it. It is your receipt that 
you have submitted your lab exercise and changing it will render it
null and void. Move it to somewhere safe where it will not be over 
written or lost.

Successful submission of the program is worth 1%


SUBMISSION CONDITIONS

Due date 11.59pm 20/04/11

Late submisions will not be accepted as I will be releasing the solution 
the following day.

Lab submissions will only be accepted via the submission system.

This is not a group exercise. Please read the Subject Outline regarding
acceptable behaviour.
